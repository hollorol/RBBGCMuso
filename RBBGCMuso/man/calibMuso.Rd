\usage{
calibMuso(settings,parameters=NULL, timee="d", debugging=FALSE, logfilename=NULL, keepEpc=FALSE, export=FALSE, silent=FALSE, aggressive=FALSE, leapYear=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{settings}{You have to run the setupMuso function before rungetMuso. It is its output which contains all of the necessary system variables. It sets the whole environment}

\item{parameters}{In the settings variable you have set the row indexes of the variables, you wish to change. In this parameter you can give an exact value for them in a vector like: c(1,2,3,4)}

\item{timee}{The required timesteps in the modell output. It can be "d", if it is daily, "m", if it's monthly, "y", it it is yearly}

\item{debugging}{If it is TRUE, it copies the log file to a Log directory to store it, if it is stamplog it contatenate a number before the logfile, which is one more than the maximum of the represented ones in the LOG directory. If it is true or stamplog it collects the "wrong" logfiles}

\item{keepEpc}{If TRUE, it keeps the epc file and stamp it, after these copies it to the EPCS directory. If debugging True or false, it copies the wrong epc files to the wrong epc directory.}

\item{export}{if it is yes or you give a filename here, it converts the output to the specific extension. For example, if you set export to "example.csv", it converts the output to "csv", if you set it to "example.xls" it converts to example.xls with the xlsx package. If it is not installed it gives back a warning message and converts it to csv.}

\item{silent}{If you set it TRUE all off the modells output to the screen will be suppressed. It can be usefull, because it increases the model-speed.}

\item{aggressive}{It deletes every possible modell-outputs from the previous modell runs.}

\item{leapyear}{future feature.}
}
\value{
No return, outputs are written to file
}
\description{
This function changes the epc file and after that  runs the BBGC-MuSo model and reads in its outputfile in a very structured way.
